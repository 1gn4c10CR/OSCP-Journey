# OSCP-Journey
## Study Map for OSCP

### Repository Description
```Since a lot of people are struggling on how to get started with the OSCP/PWK certification I wanted to share my personal study map that I have followed to get the OSCP certification, I was struggling on how to get started too so and went into lots of rabbit holes, I have found and read about 40 writeups/blogs/experiences from people that have passed the exam in the first attempt I've collected the common denominators and correlated all information to come up with this study map.```

### Documentation 
One of the most important things it's being organized and documentation for this I highly recommend using tools such as [cherrytree](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree) or any cloud based note-taking program where you can have nodes of notes, able to paste screenshots and code.

### Get started with the PWK/OSCP course
   `"Don not postpone it, people feel intimidated for it but it is normal we have all been there just get started!! the sooner the better...!"`

##### Once you get the course you will receive:
- PWK Videos
- PWK PDF
- Lab Access

### Exercices Report ###
I recommend watch the videos and see the PDF at the same time focus on completing all the exercises in order to get the 5pts bonus, some are not required.
https://help.offensive-security.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040165632-OSCP-Exam-Guide (Section Bonus Points).

``` You will have SAs (System Administrators) help throughout the whole course you will be added to a group chat pwk-oscp where you can ask for any of the exercises or request any lab troubleshooting help. ```

### Lab Report ###
Once you have done all exercises and have documented all, you can move towards the LAB where you will have [3 networks](https://help.offensive-security.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046293192-PWK-Network-Introduction-Guide) , 3 Testing Machines (WinServer, Win10, Debian), do as much as machines you can do documenting on your own words the steps on how you got system/root access,

``` You will have a forum website where the pwk-oscp student community is constantly posting "hits" and inquiries for all machines in the 3 networks, take advantage of this it is a huge help once you hit rabbit holes or get stuck for days ```

##### Here is the ["PWK Labs Learning Path"](https://help.offensive-security.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050473812) this will give you a good start in the lab and which machines to do first and the target service to exploit with the pwk modules applicable to exploit the machines.

1 or 2 weeks before your lab access expired, do the LAB Report for 10 machines in order to get the 5 bonus points (Some machines don't apply review the Bonus points documentation)

``` I have used these report templates from @whoisflynn https://github.com/whoisflynn/OSCP-Exam-Report-Template ```

For the local.txt and proof.txt I recommend to take the screenshot running the following cmds:
```sh
>type proof.txt OR cat proof.txt
>whoami
>ipconfig OR ifconfig
>date
>hostname
```
